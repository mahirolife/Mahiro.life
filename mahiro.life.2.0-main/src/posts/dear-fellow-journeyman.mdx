Dear Fellow Journeymen,  

When I drop into your presence, I feel it. It’s an understanding that goes beyond comprehension. There is compassion. Compassion like how tree roots provide water for the leaves. I have seen glimpses of what this is all about, and this is what I see. I wonder if you resonate.  

We are all on a journey. Not on the same path, but nevertheless, we are all on a path. We don’t really have a say in where the path takes us. But once we see the path, we can’t unsee it. We can try to deviate from it, but our hearts will bring us right back. I don’t quite understand what this is all about, but what I do understand is that you are on a journey too. You are a fellow journeyman.  

Our paths have crossed, and I cherished every step that we got to take together. What a blessing. The journey is so lonely at times. It's scary, and it's confusing. As to why you and I crossed paths in this eternal adventure, I can only speculate. Perhaps we have something to teach one another. Maybe we have crossed paths many, many times in our past lives. Maybe it's purely random.  

Although I know that we each have to take our own steps, I enjoyed goofing around, sharing our insights, and even carrying each other's sack when the weight gets too heavy on our shoulders. I even felt joy as we marched on together, secretly hoping we could keep walking together until we reached the end. But when the paths split in two, we both know which way to head, and that is when we go our own ways.  

We can’t fight it; it is just the way the water flows. We know we can’t accompany each other for the whole journey. I watch you as you courageously march on into the unknown. I may be waving to you with a smile, but inside I feel like a piece of me has broken off. I become unsure if I can keep going.  

You have, however, left me with the greatest gift. Watching you march on gives me the courage to do the same. Knowing that somewhere you are pushing forward, jumping obstacles, and facing the shadows, I know I can do it too.  

March on, fellow journeymen. I have got your back. When you get lost, listen to your heart. If the noise is consuming you and you can’t hear your heart, read this letter; I promise I am on the journey too. Don’t let fear bring doubt to your journey. And don’t forget to enjoy the view. You have come a long way!  

Metta, Mahiro
